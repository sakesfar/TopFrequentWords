# TopFrequentWords
A simple app that generates top N frequent words.

In the code N is set to 15.
The words are displayed in the form of a bar chart.
The user can control processing with the "cancel" button.

**Working principle:**
A user selects a txt file. The file is processed in WordsFrequencyAnalyzer. This processing is a separate thread.
Since we can't listen to signals from the working thread, there is a wrapper class called "AnalyzerListener" in *ver1* and "Controller" in *ver2*.
The wrapper class redirects emitted signals to the GUI thread.



In **ver1** a thread is created in a *main.cpp* and the working object is sent there, while in **ver2**  the working thread is a member variable of the *Controller* class.
